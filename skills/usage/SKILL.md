name: usage
description: Inspect remaining provider subscription usage, plans, reset windows, live token throughput, and global token totals. Use when the user asks about usage, quota, remaining limits, what is burning tokens right now, token spend over time, Codex/Claude/Cursor plan usage, or when to wait for a reset.
---

# Usage dashboard

Run `bb usage` (or `bb usage --json`) to read live subscription windows
and token totals. Source ownership is described in
[README: How it works](../../README.md#how-it-works).

```bash
bb usage
bb usage --json
bb usage live                 # tokens per minute right now, by provider and thread
bb usage tokens --days 30
bb usage --machine <id-or-name>
```

Use `totals.cumulativeRemainingPercent` for remaining quota across signed-in
providers, `totals.tightest` for the most exhausted window, and each provider
`windows[].remainingPercent` when deciding whether a thread should wait for a
reset. Provider rows may also include `credits`, `resetCredits`, and
`spendControl`; for Codex these expose purchased-credit balance, banked reset
availability/expiry, and any backend-reported on-demand period. A window's
`cost` gives exact used/limit dollars when the provider reports them. For dated
token totals versus separately visible unknown-window and historical
observations, follow [README: How it works](../../README.md#how-it-works).

`bb usage live` answers "what is being burned right now": `tokensPerMinute` is
the trailing-60-second rate, `peakTokensPerMinute` the best rate in the last 15
minutes, and `threads[]` attributes it to the threads doing the work. Archived
and deleted threads are omitted. It counts only what BB drives, so an agent
run outside BB does not appear.
